# Contributing to mmCEsim

## Project Structure

The project is configured with CMake, and the role of each folder is listed below.
- `include`: C++ Header Files (`.h`)
  - `export`: Header Files Concerning ALG Export
  - `mmcesim`: Files Needed by mmCEsim Binary
    - `copy`: Contents Directly Copied to Form Generated C++/Python/Matlab Code
    - `tex`: $\rm\LaTeX$ Files for Report Generation
- `src`: C++ Source Files (`.cpp`)
  - `export`: Class Implementations Corresponding to Those in `include/export`
- `ext`: 3rd Party Resources
  - `astyle`: Format Generated C++ Code
  - `fmt`: C++ String Format (Like That in C++20)
  - `yaml-cpp`: Parse YAML Configuration (`.sim`)
- `test`: Test Files Including `CTest` Configuration
- `tools`: Accompanying Tools (`maintain` and `compose`)
- `doc`: Documentation (*Currently Empty*)
- `bin`: Generated Binary Executable
- `misc`: Miscellaneous Files

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still under active development and the structure is subject to potential changes.

## Code Style
The C++ code style is based on LLVM,
with additional configuration listed in [`.clang-format`](.clang-format).

```
.misc/format
```
to format the code before committing.

[^1]: Appropriate permission is needed.
On a Unix (Linux and macOS) system, you may use `chmod +x ./misc/format`.
